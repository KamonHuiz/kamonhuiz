## About me
I'm a **first-year Computer Science student** at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)**.  
I am doing research about Knowledge Graph and having a dilemma over NLP and CV.
I am still learning and exploring to find my research interests.  
I love collaborating, sharing knowledge, and learning from others in the community.
